My name is Miguel, I'm 16 years old, I'm currently on a Programming course, I'm currently a Full-Stack Web Developer, I also make games on Godot, GameMaker, Construct and Unity (I intend to learn how to use Unreal Engine as soon as possible), now I started to develop bots for websites and social networks and finally I make any kind of application.
